# TeamAI CLI

CLI for syncing team skills, rules, docs, and env across AI coding tools. Package: [`teamai-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/teamai-cli).

TypeScript, Node 20+, tsup (ESM), Vitest. Commands: `npm run build`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npx vitest run`.

## Git

- Default branch: `main`. Worktrees and PRs based on `origin/main`.
- PR only to `Tencent/teamai-cli`. Before push, check `git log origin/main..HEAD`; rebase or cherry-pick if unrelated commits appear.
- **必须使用 Worktree**：改代码前先 `EnterWorktree`，禁止在主工作目录修改。

## Rules

- CLI user-facing output must be English. No Chinese in production code. Tests assert English output.
- Keep bilingual docs in sync (`README` / `*.zh-CN.md`, `docs/usage-guide.*`). Behavior changes must update every affected doc (including `docs/designs/`); grep old wording before opening the PR.
- **奥卡姆剃刀**：避免过早添加新 CLI 命令；非必要不加；优先复用或扩展现有命令与选项。

## PR 前测试

`npm run build` 后用真实 CLI 对本次改动做完整端到端验证（不能只跑 type check / unit test）。Test Plan 每一项必须实际通过，测试报告贴进 PR。

- Agent：Claude、Codex、CodeBuddy、OpenCode
- Provider：`git`、`gitlab`、`github`

## CodeGraph

In repositories indexed by CodeGraph (a `.codegraph/` directory exists at the repo root), reach for it BEFORE grep/find or reading files when you need to understand or locate code:

- **MCP tool** (when available): `codegraph_explore` answers most code questions in one call — the relevant symbols' verbatim source plus the call paths between them, including dynamic-dispatch hops grep can't follow. Name a file or symbol in the query to read its current line-numbered source. If it's listed but deferred, load it by name via tool search.
- **Shell** (always works): `codegraph explore "<symbol names or question>"` prints the same output.

If there is no `.codegraph/` directory, skip CodeGraph entirely — indexing is the user's decision.
