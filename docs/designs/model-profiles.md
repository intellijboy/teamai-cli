# Model profile management

## Goals and boundaries

Model profiles let a team publish one gateway catalog that every supported agent (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, CodeBuddy, WorkBuddy, Pi) can use, and let an individual keep personal gateways, without turning the team Git repository into a secret store.

- The catalog format stays small: `id`, `name`, `base_url`, `api_key: ${API_KEY}` (a placeholder), and `model_groups`. There are no per-agent sections; agent support follows from protocols.
- Agents change only after an explicit `teamai models switch`. From then on `teamai pull` re-applies the team's latest catalog to the agents switched to it. Agents never switched are never touched.
- Everything TeamAI writes into an agent file can be restored, and a field the user changes is never overwritten.

## Data ownership

| Data | Location | Git-tracked | Contains secrets |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Team profiles | `<team repo>/models/models.yaml`, plus `models/<ns>/models.yaml` per namespace | Yes | No |
| Personal profiles | `~/.teamai/models/models.yaml` | No | No |
| Personal API keys | `~/.teamai/models/values.json` | No, mode `0600` | Key or env-var name |
| Team-profile API keys | `~/.teamai/models/teams/<repo-identity-hash>.json` | No, mode `0600` | Key or env-var name |
| Ownership and restore state | `~/.teamai/models/managed.json` | No, mode `0600` | May hold previous and written keys |

A key is either stored or referenced as an environment variable; it is never accepted as a command-line argument. `0600` is not encryption. The team-key file name is a hash of the repository identity; the sanitized `teamai.yaml` team name plays no part in it, so renaming the team never orphans the keys. When no repository identity exists at all (no usable remote, URL, or `repo:` claim), the name hashes the team slug with the path instead — there is nothing repository-shaped to key on, and the slug keeps differently named teams that share a checkout path apart. While the hash-only file does not exist yet, a legacy `<slug>-<hash>.json` from an older version is read where it lies — nothing is renamed — and the next save writes the hash-only name. A legacy file under a repository-bound digest (a URL, a URL-shaped `repo:` claim or remote) carries its host in the identity, so it is read by digest alone; a legacy file under a **provider-ambiguous** digest (a path-shaped `repo:` claim, a provider-relative remote, a bare alias, or no repository identity) names no single repository — the old name scheme never encoded the provider, so two providers' same-named teams hash the same file, and the slug cannot prove ownership across providers. Such a file is never read by a silent rule: the CLI surfaces it once and the user explicitly adopts the exact `<slug>-<hash>` identity for this checkout, after which the read happens and the next save migrates the keys to the provider-qualified hash-only name. Non-interactive and `--dry-run` runs never adopt: they report the file and leave it unread. Switch records under a provider-ambiguous identity are never claimed either — the old name never encoded the provider, so no slug (not even this checkout's exact slug) proves ownership: a GitHub and a GitCode team both named `Alpha` on the bare claim `acme/widgets` share the identical `alpha-<digest>` form. No machine-global record is ever used as proof, because a store shared by every checkout on the machine would equally belong to a foreign team; the explicit adoption of the values file re-establishes this team's presence, and its switched agents are re-recorded by the next `models switch` under the provider-qualified identity. Repository-bound switch records still match by digest alone. The identity is recorded with each `team:` switch so `pull` only re-applies the current team's profiles. Inside it, each key is stored under `team:<id>@<origin>`; see [Namespaces and key binding](#namespaces-and-key-binding).

Model profile keys are not [team secrets](team-secrets.md): `teamai env set` does not configure them, `env/secrets.yaml` cannot declare one, and the two stores share code, not files.

## Catalog and protocols

```yaml
profiles:
  - id: tokenhub
    name: Tencent TokenHub
    base_url: https://tokenhub.tencentmaas.com
    api_key: ${API_KEY}
    model_groups:
      - protocols: [anthropic, openai-chat-completions]
        models: [glm-5.3, deepseek-v4-flash]
```

Protocols are `anthropic`, `openai-responses`, and `openai-chat-completions`, declared per group and never inferred. Anthropic uses the root URL, the OpenAI protocols `<root>/v1`, and Buddy entries the full `<root>/v1/chat/completions`. `base_url` may not end in `/v1` or carry credentials, a query, or a fragment; unknown fields and duplicate model IDs are rejected. A gateway whose protocols live under unrelated paths cannot be expressed yet; that would be an optional per-protocol URL override, added when a team needs it.

The first model in the catalog is the default. `switch --model <id>` chooses another one; the choice is remembered for later re-applies. `configure --protocol/--model` edits keep the first model first.

Team and personal profiles live in the `team:` and `local:` namespaces. An unqualified ID works only when unique, and `models add` refuses an ID the team already uses.

## Namespaces and key binding

Team profiles follow the namespace rule every resource type uses (#707): `models/models.yaml` is shared, and `models/<ns>/models.yaml` is read only where `<ns>` is active in `resources.models` of the member's roles or projects. A namespace profile replaces the root profile with the same `id`, whole. The same `id` in two active namespaces, or an active file that does not parse, stops model updates for that pull and leaves every agent as it is; a repeated `id` in one file is already a parse error. Legacy mode (no roles, no projects) reads the root file only.

An override can move a profile to another gateway, so a team key is bound to the profile `id` and the origin of `base_url` (scheme, host, port), and is stored under `team:<id>@<origin>`. A key is only ever written into an agent next to a gateway on that origin:

- `pull` re-applies a profile only when a key is stored for its current origin. When one is stored for the `id` but another origin, it leaves the agents alone and prints `teamai models switch team:<id>`, which asks for the new gateway's key. This covers a root profile moved to another host as well as an override.
- Keys for several origins of one `id` coexist, so leaving a namespace returns agents to the root profile with the key stored for it, without a prompt.
- A key stored before this rule, under `team:<id>`, is bound once, by the first pull or `models` command that reads it: to the origin TeamAI last wrote into the agents switched to that profile (the root profile's current origin when it is among them), or to the root profile's current origin when no agent was switched to it. It never follows the root profile to a later host, so a root profile moved between the beta and the upgrade does not receive it. Without a root profile of that `id` it stays unbound and is not used.
- A profile that exists only in a namespace the member left is not undone: the agents keep their settings and `pull` says the profile `is no longer active in your namespaces`; `teamai models restore` undoes it.

## Agent writes

| Agent | Protocol | Managed fields |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code | `anthropic` | In `settings.json.env`: base URL, auth token, `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_{OPUS,SONNET,HAIKU}_MODEL`, gateway discovery off; cleared while managed: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_HEADERS`, `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`, server-delivered `ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_MODEL_OPTION{,_NAME}`. Top level: `model` and a `modelPicker` listing every model |
| Codex | `openai-responses` | Top-level `model`, `model_provider`, and `[model_providers.teamai]`; `auth.json` is never touched |
| OpenCode | any | Top-level `model` and providers `teamai-anthropic`, `teamai-chat`, `teamai-responses`; a model served over several protocols is registered once, preferring Chat Completions |
| CodeBuddy / WorkBuddy | `openai-chat-completions` | One `models.json` entry per model; a non-empty `availableModels` gets the managed IDs |
| Pi | any | One `models.json` provider, keyed by the profile ref; a model served over several protocols is registered once, preferring an OpenAI one. `settings.json` is never touched |

Claude family aliases point at the first gateway model whose ID contains `opus`, `sonnet`, or `haiku`, else the default, so background work and subagents never request a model the gateway lacks. Keys referenced by environment variable are written as `env_key` (Codex), `{env:VAR}` (OpenCode), `${VAR}` (CodeBuddy/WorkBuddy), and `$VAR` (Pi); Claude has no such syntax and receives the resolved key.

Codex is edited line by line to keep comments and formatting. The result is parsed and compared with the intended values before writing; an unusual layout the edit cannot handle fails without touching the file.

## Ownership and restore

Before the first switch TeamAI records the managed fields' values. When a later switch drops a Buddy model from the catalog, its original entry is put back at once and TeamAI stops tracking that ID, so a user entry that reuses it is never touched by restore. Each later switch, pull re-apply, or restore first compares the current fields with what TeamAI last wrote; if they differ, the user or another tool took over and TeamAI skips that agent. Claude's top-level `model` is excluded from that comparison because `/model` writes the user's pick there: a re-apply keeps the pick while the catalog still offers it, and restore keeps a model TeamAI never offered.

Claude is refused while `settings.json` enables Bedrock, Vertex, or Foundry. Shell `ANTHROPIC_*` values that differ from what TeamAI writes produce a warning, not a refusal: host apps such as the Claude Code desktop app set them for their own sessions.

Writes are ordered to survive interruption: a pending record is saved, the agent file is replaced atomically, and the pending mark is cleared. The next command settles an interrupted operation only when the managed fields match either side; otherwise the agent is skipped. A write that fails removes its pending record. The record pins the agent's config path (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, `CODEX_HOME`, `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, `OPENCODE_CONFIG`, `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` are honored), so a later path change never redirects a restore. A lock serializes model operations; `pull` confirms under that lock that an agent still uses the profile it decided to re-apply.

While a profile is active on an agent, the local-agent server model delivery pauses for it. A full user-scope uninstall restores model settings before removing MCP servers and stops, keeping the record, if any agent cannot be restored; project-scope uninstall leaves these machine-wide settings alone.

## Team agents and model aliases

A team agent whose `model` is an alias (`strong`, `fast`, or a team alias in `models/aliases.yaml`) is resolved per tool on each pull. On a switched tool the gateway does not know the account's models, so pull filters what the member's override or the team entry gives that tool: Claude keeps `opus`, `sonnet` or `haiku`, which the family routing above sends to a gateway model, and drops any other model; Codex, OpenCode, CodeBuddy and WorkBuddy get no `model` field. No switched tool gets an effort, the alias's or one set in `tool_extras.<tool>`, unless `tool_extras.<tool>` also pins a model. No `model` field means the tool's native inheritance, not the profile's model: Codex may use `[agents].default_subagent_model` or the parent session's model. `tool_extras.<tool>.model`, a concrete `model`, and a member's `~`/`default` opt-out are not filtered. A tool counts as switched with the same checks restore makes, read from the record without the lock: the recorded config path is the live one and the managed fields still hold what TeamAI wrote. Variants such as tclaude or codex-internal have no record and are never switched. Pull records what each agent copy received, so an ordinary pull after `models switch` or `models restore` rewrites the affected agents. Push reads a model hand-edited into a switched tool's copy as drift, leaves it out, and points at `teamai models restore --agent <tool>`.

### Namespaced aliases

Aliases follow the same namespace rule as profiles: `models/<ns>/aliases.yaml` is read where `<ns>` is active in `resources.models`, from the directory the profiles of `<ns>` are read from, and legacy mode reads `models/aliases.yaml` alone. A namespace alias replaces the root alias of the same name whole, with no per-tool merge, so a tool the namespace alias does not map gets no `model` field even when the root maps it. The same alias in two active namespaces is a resolution failure, handled like a structural error: pull holds the agents with a `model` field and names both files. Which names are aliases does not depend on activation: a name that any aliases file in the checkout defines, root or namespace, active or not, is an alias, so an agent whose alias only an inactive namespace defines gets no `model` field rather than the name written literally, and a member's local entry for it still applies; pull warns once per such alias, naming its files, since a name that is also a model id (`gpt-5-codex`) would otherwise take that model away without notice. For the same reason, a structural error in any aliases file of the checkout, active or not, fails resolution. Pull records the file each resolution came from, and push drift and pull warnings name that file. `doctor` notes each alias that agents the member receives use and that a namespace file defines where the namespace is not active. `doctor` also lists, per alias agent and installed tool, the model and effort resolved now, the step and source file, and the recorded value when the last pull deployed something else; it fails `Agent model aliases can be resolved` while resolution fails (a structural error in any aliases file, a namespace conflict, an unreadable switched tool), and the agents delivery check does not count held agents as unreachable.
