# Scenario: Uninstall — remove TeamAI from this machine

The user wants to remove TeamAI. **You run the command for them** — they should not
have to type `teamai uninstall` themselves. Everything you say goes in the user's
language (global rule 1); only the commands stay verbatim.

## Step 1 — Confirm scope first (ASK — this is destructive)

Uninstalling removes hooks and synced resources from the machine and cannot be
undone with a single button, so confirm before running anything. Ask ONE question:

*"Do you want to remove TeamAI from **just this AI tool**, or from the **whole
machine** (all tools)?"*

- **Just this tool** → `--agent <tool>` (use the tool this conversation runs in,
  e.g. `claude`). Shared resources are removed only if it is the last tool using
  them. An instructions file several tools read (CodeBuddy and WorkBuddy share
  `.codebuddy/rules/teamai-context.md`) is cleaned block by block: a teamai
  block stays while a remaining tool on that file still writes it, so
  `--agent workbuddy` keeps that file while CodeBuddy is installed. A file an
  earlier release wrote the blocks to, such as the project `AGENTS.md`, loses
  its teamai blocks, since no tool reads them there now. A file teamai created
  goes with its last block; one the user had before stays, even if empty.
- **Whole machine** → no `--agent` flag.

Reassure them (in their language): *"This only removes things from your computer.
Your team's repo on the website is untouched — you can rejoin any time with
`/teamai` and the repo URL."*

## Step 2 — Run it (you run it)

A targeted project exclusion needs the same confirmation even when there are no local files to remove. `--dry-run` and declining confirmation leave the project config unchanged.

Whole machine:

```bash
teamai uninstall
```

Just the current tool (example for Claude Code):

```bash
teamai uninstall --agent claude
```

`teamai uninstall` asks for a confirmation of its own. Let the user answer that
prompt. Only add `--force` (skips the prompt) if the user has already clearly told
you to go ahead without further confirmation:

```bash
teamai uninstall --force
```

## Step 3 — Report the result in the user's language

Tell them what was removed and remind them, in one line, how to come back:
*"Done — TeamAI has been removed from this machine. To rejoin later, run `/teamai`
and give it your team repo URL."*

## Notes

- Uninstall cleans legacy Codex rule copies at the recorded `toolRoots`
  location, including publishers' bare local filenames. It keeps edited copies.
  For a rule the team has
  removed, it deletes the copy only if its hash matches the recorded delivery.
  Without that record, it keeps the copy and names it in a warning. Save any
  changes you need, then delete the copy manually.
- If an OpenCode config entry cannot be removed, repair its config or permissions
  and retry the same uninstall command. Uninstall reports failure and keeps
  its ownership record and shared data directory, even for the last tool.
- Project uninstall keeps the global Pi and Oh My Pi extensions, Hermes
  plugin and config, and the Codex family's user-level hooks, which the user
  scope, the HTTP agent or another project may use, and names them. If none
  does, run `teamai hooks remove` in the project first: it removes them.
  Targeted project Codex uninstall keeps project config and records its
  exclusion, even without local resources. Legacy project hook copies go.
  User-scope uninstall removes these global channels.
  The retained adapters respect project exclusions, including cached HTTP
  prompt injection and HTTP sync. An excluded tool does not download its
  resources again on the next session start.
- An enabled, installed Pi, Oh My Pi, Hermes or project Codex also keeps the
  project's shared state in use without a local tool directory. Uninstalling
  another tool preserves that state and the remaining tool's instructions.
- Do **not** delete the team repo on the Git platform — uninstall never touches it,
  and neither should you.
- If the user only wants to stop auto-sync for one tool but keep TeamAI otherwise,
  that is the `--agent <tool>` form, not a full uninstall.
- In a project, uninstall also removes teamai's git hook: the
  `hook.teamai-post-checkout` / `hook.teamai-post-merge` entries in the repo's git
  config and the `# >>> teamai git hook` block in `.git/hooks/post-checkout` and
  `post-merge`. Other hooks stay; a script left with only its shebang is deleted.
- In a project, uninstall also takes teamai's lines out of `.git/info/exclude`
  (the `# [teamai:mcp-exclude:start]` block) for MCP configs it proves hold no
  resolved `${VAR}` value. A line names the path a write lands in: for a config
  under a symlinked directory, the link's target (`/config/mcp.json` for
  `.cursor/` linking to `config/`). For one it cannot prove clean (including one written
  under a `toolPaths` mapping since changed, at the built-in location of a tool
  the team dropped or moved that no other tool maps, or in a nested repository's
  linked worktree, that still holds servers, and one written for a tool since moved
  (or at its built-in location) that another tool maps, holding a server that tool
  did not write) it keeps the line
  and warns, naming the file and why: have the user remove teamai's servers from
  that file, then delete the line (with the last one, the block's markers). Do not
  delete a kept line while its file still holds a token.
