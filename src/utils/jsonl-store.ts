/**
 * An append-only JSON-lines file that concurrent hooks can write safely (#788,
 * #884). Every writer takes `<file>.lock`: appends, and rewrites that prune or
 * truncate. A rewrite therefore cannot drop an append made while it runs, and
 * two rewrites cannot interleave.
 *
 * An append waits only briefly for the lock, because hooks run inside the
 * host's foreground budget. When the lock stays held, the record goes to a side
 * file of its own, `<name>.pending-<uuid>.jsonl`, which the next lock holder
 * folds into the file. Readers can include those side records, so a record is
 * visible before it is folded.
 *
 * A hook process is killed when its handler times out, so any step may be cut
 * short: a lock whose owner is gone is reclaimed, a side record still missing
 * its newline is left for a later holder, a torn last line is skipped on read
 * and never glued to the next record, and a rewrite's temp copy is removed by
 * the next rewrite.
