   * Swift only. The names that could bind this call's callee (or receiver),
   * gathered from the top-level declaration that encloses the call site:
   * function and closure parameters, local `let`/`var`, and whatever a
   * `for` / `if let` / `guard let` / `catch let` / `case let` introduces, plus
   * stored properties, generic parameters and closure capture lists.
   *
   * A call whose callee (or receiver) is one of these names refers to that
   * binding, so a module-wide lookup must not claim it: `run(work:) { work() }`
   * calls the parameter, not a sibling file's `func work()`. Only the syntax
   * tree knows this, which is why it is recorded here and not recomputed in the
   * resolver.
   *
   * Collected per declaration rather than per call site: the declaration is read
   * whole, and what it yields is the names the declaration *binds* — the
   * positions the grammar marks as introductions. A name that merely occurs in
   * the declaration, such as one passed as an argument or used as an
   * initializer, is a use and does not count. Both directions of error are not
   * equal here: an extra name costs a resolution, a missing one invents a
   * cross-file edge. Absent for non-Swift files and for sites with no such
   * binding.
