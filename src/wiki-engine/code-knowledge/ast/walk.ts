 * module-wide:

 *   one would let an unqualified call in one file bind to an unrelated method in
 *   another, and two same-named members would also look like an ambiguous module
 *   name and suppress a resolution that was correct.
 * - **Not file-scoped.** `private` and `fileprivate` narrow a declaration to the
 *   file that declares it (or to its enclosing declaration), so a sibling cannot
 *   see it. `private(set)` narrows only the setter and is *not* file-scoped;
 *   the grammar reports it as `private(set)`, which the comparison below leaves
 *   alone.
 *
 * Absence of a `modifiers` child means the default, `internal`, which the whole
 * module sees.
 *
 * `namedChildren` is typed `(Node | null)[]` in web-tree-sitter, so both child
 * lookups below are null-guarded with `?.`. The `?.` is load-bearing: without it
