/**
 * Swift has no source-level package or module declaration — unlike Go's
 * `package` clause or Python's file-as-module rule, the module boundary is a
 * build-system fact that the AST cannot read. The only layout with a mandated
 * shape is SwiftPM: everything under `<package>/Sources/<Target>/` is one
 * module, and everything under `<package>/Tests/<Target>/` is another (test
 * targets see the library through `@testable import`, not by being the same
 * module).
 *
 * The key spans the path *up to and including* the target directory, not just
 * the `Sources/<Target>` tail. One repository can hold several Swift packages
 * side by side, and `Packages/A/Sources/App` and `Packages/B/Sources/App` are
 * two different modules that happen to share their last two segments; keying on
 * the tail alone would merge them and let a name in one package resolve into
 * the other.
 *
 * The marker that counts is the *innermost* one, because a package can also be
 * nested under a directory the outer package already named `Sources` or `Tests`:
 * `Tests/Fixtures/A/Sources/App` is package A's target `App`, not a target of the
 * outer package. Derived from the path shape alone, this is still an inference,
 * so the scan is deliberately biased towards under-scoping — see the loop below.
 *
 * Outside that layout this function returns `undefined` on purpose. Guessing a
 * module boundary from an arbitrary directory tree would fabricate edges
 * between files that Swift actually keeps apart, and a wrong edge is worse than
 * a missing one: the missing one still surfaces as a gap.

  // are two packages that share an outer `Tests` segment, and taking the first
  // marker would scope both to `Tests/Fixtures` and merge them.
  //
  // The direction also decides how a layout this function misreads can fail.
  // An inner marker can only ever yield a scope nested *inside* the true module,

  // fabricates an edge. Missing beats wrong here for the same reason it does

 * declarations, so a module-level function of the same name looks like the only
 * candidate and is claimed as the target.
 *
 * Answering the question per type would need the inheritance and conformance
 * graph of the whole module, which this layer does not build. Asking it of the
 * module — does *any* type declare this member? — needs only the names already
 * extracted, and errs the way the rest of the layer errs: a call that does turn
 * out to be the module-level one, made from a module where some unrelated type
 * declares a member of the same name, loses its edge. A missing edge still shows
