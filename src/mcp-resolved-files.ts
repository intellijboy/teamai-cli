//  earlier pull wrote under a toolPaths mapping the team has since changed is
//  no longer anyone's target, and a record rebuilt after it was lost cannot
//  tell teamai's stale entries from the member's own (#882). This file, next
//  to the worktree's managed-mcp.json, remembers both: each project MCP config
//  a pull wrote a resolved value to, by absolute path, with the tools it wrote
//  it for, and the servers it found there when it rebuilt a lost record. It
//  also says whether a pull has read the files earlier revisions of the team's
//  teamai.yaml mapped, which a teamai from before this file wrote to without
//  recording them, and remembers one of those git tracked, which no line can
//  protect until the member stops git tracking it. Nothing depends on it to
//  keep a line: missing or unreadable, it reads as empty and the rules without
//  it apply.
