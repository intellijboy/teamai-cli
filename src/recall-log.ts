 * line each. The adoption reducer joins them at Stop, SubagentStop and `pull`,
 * and only `pull` prunes the log (drainRecallLog).
 *
 *   run       recall searched: the session from the environment, its caller and the docs it returned
 *   claim     the PostToolUse of a shell call that printed a run id: its actor, and whether it ran the recall itself
 *   evidence  a PostToolUse read of a file under the knowledge roots, or a search that showed its lines, by its actor: its path and status, never its command or output
 *   link      a child session a subagent ran in, and the session that started it (OpenCode's task tool)
 *   consumed  evidence that has been credited, so it never votes again
 *
 * It never holds a query, prompt, tool output or file content. It is local and
 * owner-only, and lives in `dashboard/`, which every data home's `.gitignore`
 * already ignores, so no new ignore entry is needed for it or its side files.
